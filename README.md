# Fontra Pak

Fontra Pak is a cross-platform, standalone, bundled [Fontra](https://github.com/fontra/fontra) application for desktop use.

## Download

Binaries for MacOS (11 and up), Windows (10 and up) and Ubuntu x86_64 can be [downloaded under releases](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/releases/latest).

For Linux, there are more options, such as `flatpak` and `snap`: https://docs.fontra.xyz/how-tos/installation/installing-fontra-pak-linux/

## Run locally from source

To run the main program directly, set up a Python 3.11 (or higher) virtual environment, install the requirements from `requirements.txt`, then run:

    python FontraPakMain.py

## Native Linux installation

Fontra Pak can also be run directly from its Python environment on Linux.

This avoids the self-contained PyInstaller bundle. The app runs from a Python virtual environment and uses the host's Wayland/X11, fontconfig and graphics libraries.

Requirements: git and network access. Python 3.11 or newer and Node.js 24 or newer (with npm) are also needed. If either is missing, the installer offers to download it (Python with uv, Node.js with nvm). Run `./linux/install.sh --yes` to accept the downloads without prompts. A Python downloaded with uv stays in `~/.local/share/uv/python`; `uninstall.sh` does not remove it.

To install for the current user:

    ./linux/install.sh

The default installation prefix is `~/.local`.

The launcher is installed as:

    ~/.local/bin/fontrapak

A desktop entry is also installed for the graphical desktop environment.

To uninstall:

    ./linux/uninstall.sh

## Build a self-contained application locally

To build a self-contained application, set up a Python 3.11 (or higher) virtual environment, install the requirements from `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`, then run:

    pyinstaller FontraPak.spec -y

## How it works

Drop a font file onto application icon, or launch the application, and drop a font file onto the drop area or use the "Open File..." button to choose one. Or use the "New font..." button to create a new font.
